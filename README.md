# Gesture-Controlled-Input-Device
The Gesture Control input device is a keyboard and a mouse, all in one device. The keyboard inputs and cursors are controlled by gestures using this device. The device uses a MPU 6050 sensor which is used to get the gyroscope and accelerometer values, which is used to control the mouse and the keyboard. A SVM neural network model is trained for the device to detect the gestures and print the respective keyboard output on the computer screen.

Components used:
Hardware:
1. Arduino Leonardo
2. MPU 6050
3. Push Buttons

Software:
1. Arduino IDE
2. Any Python IDE
3. Pygarl library

Credits:
I would like to thank RoboVITics to give me this opportunity to work on this project. I would also like to thank Fedrico Terzi, the creator of the pygarl library and the original creator of the gesture controlled keyboard. The pygarl library was very essential to this project.
